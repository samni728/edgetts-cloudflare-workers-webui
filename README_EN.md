## ‚ú® Feature Highlights

- **üöÄ OpenAI Compatible**: Fully simulates OpenAI's `/v1/audio/speech` interface, can be directly called by official OpenAI SDK or any existing tools.
- **üó£Ô∏è High-Quality Voices**: Utilizes various natural and fluent neural network voices provided by Microsoft Edge TTS.
- **üåä Streaming Support**: Supports both **streaming** and **standard** (non-streaming) response modes, streaming responses can significantly reduce first-play latency for long texts.
- **üß† Smart Text Cleaning**: Built-in powerful "text cleaning pipeline" that automatically processes messy text copied from PDFs or web pages:
  - Remove Markdown formatting.
  - Remove Emoji expressions.
  - Remove URL links.
  - Remove citation marker numbers in papers or documents (like `...text 1.`), while preserving meaningful numbers (like years, quantities).
  - Remove all excess spaces and hard line breaks, ensuring natural and coherent Chinese listening experience.
  - Support custom keyword filtering.
- **üéõÔ∏è Flexible Parameter Configuration**: Supports dynamic adjustment of all core parameters through API requests, including voice, speed, pitch, chunk size, concurrency, and all cleaning options.
- **üåê Zero-dependency Deployment**: Script is completely self-contained, optional KV storage configuration, extremely simple deployment process.
- **üíª Convenient Testing Tools**: Provides a feature-rich WebUI, allowing users to test all functions without writing any code.
- **üóÑÔ∏è Smart History Records**: Automatically saves all TTS generation records, supports viewing, managing, and sharing.
- **üîó One-click Sharing**: Generate share links with password protection, convenient for sharing audio content with others.
- **üîê Secure Access Control**: Supports API key verification, ensuring secure and reliable service.

## üöÄ How It Works?

This Worker script acts as an intelligent "middleman".

1. **Receive Requests**: It receives a `POST` request with exactly the same format as OpenAI TTS API.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: It immediately runs a powerful text cleaning pipeline to purify input text for optimal listening experience.
3. **Smart Decision Making**: It quickly estimates the resources needed to process the text.
   - **Short Text**: If text length is within safe range, it uses the most efficient "direct synchronous mode" for processing.
   - **Long Text**: If text length might trigger Cloudflare platform limits, it automatically enables "self-regulation mechanism", recalculating and adjusting chunking strategy to ensure 100% task success.
4. **Chunking and Concurrency**: It splits the processed text into small chunks and sends requests to Microsoft Edge TTS servers in batches based on your specified concurrency.
5. **Return Results**:
   - **Standard Mode**: Wait for all audio chunks to return, concatenate into a complete MP3 file and return at once.
   - **Streaming Mode**: Start sending data to client immediately upon receiving the first audio chunk, achieving low-latency playback.

## Deployment Guide

Deploying this service is very simple, taking only a few minutes.

### Prerequisites

- A Cloudflare account (free version is sufficient)

### Step 1: Create Cloudflare Pages Project

1. Log in to your [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
2. In the left menu, find and click **Workers and Pages**
3. Click **Create Application** ‚Üí **Pages** ‚Üí **Upload Assets**
4. Specify a name for your project (e.g., `my-edge-tts`)

#### Deployment Method Selection

**Method 1: Using Release Package (Recommended)**

- Download the release package from [v1.1 Release](https://github.com/samni728/edgetts-cloudflare-workers-webui/releases/tag/v1.1)
- Drag and drop the downloaded zip file directly in Cloudflare Pages WebUI
- System will automatically extract and deploy all files

**Method 2: Single File Deployment**

- Upload `_worker.js` file to project root directory
- Ensure the file is in the root directory, not in subfolders

**Method 3: Directory Structure Deployment**

- If you have a complete project directory structure, you can drag and drop the entire directory
- Ensure `_worker.js` file is in the root directory

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables and KV Storage

#### 2.1 Configure API Key

To ensure API security, you need to set an API key to control access.

1. After project creation, go to project settings page
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
3. Add environment variable:
   - **Type**: Select `Secret`
   - **Variable Name**: `API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Enter a key you set yourself (e.g., `sk-my-secret-key-12345`)
   - **Environment**: Select `Production`
4. Click **Add Variable** to complete configuration

![Configure API_KEY Environment Variable](API_KEY.jpg)

_The above image shows the complete process of configuring API_KEY environment variable in Cloudflare Pages. Select "Secret" type, enter variable name "API_KEY" and corresponding value, then click "Add Variable" to complete configuration._

#### 2.2 Configure KV Storage (Optional)

If you need to use history and sharing features, you need to configure KV storage:

1. On project settings page, click **Settings** ‚Üí **Bindings**
2. Click **+ Add** button
3. Select **KV Namespace**
4. Configure KV binding:
   - **Variable Name**: `TTS_HISTORY`
   - **KV Namespace**: Select or create a KV namespace (e.g., `tts_kv`)
5. Click **Save** to complete configuration

![Configure KV Storage](TTS_HISTORY.jpg)

_The above image shows the complete process of configuring KV storage in Cloudflare Pages. Add KV namespace in bindings page, set variable name to "TTS_HISTORY", and select corresponding KV namespace._

**Important Notes**:

- API key cannot be viewed again once saved, please keep it safe
- Recommend using complex random strings as keys
- This key will be used for subsequent API call authentication
- KV storage is used to save history records and sharing data, without configuration these features will be unavailable

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Reminder**: After setting or modifying environment variables, **you must redeploy once** for changes to take effect!

### Step 3: Deploy

1. Return to project homepage
2. Click **Create New Deployment**
3. After confirming files are uploaded correctly, click **Save and Deploy**
4. Deployment complete

**Redeployment Instructions**:

- After each environment variable modification, redeployment is required
- Click **Create New Deployment** or **Redeploy** on project homepage
- Ensure correct environment is selected (Production)
- New environment variables will take effect after deployment completion

### Step 4: Access and Use

1. **Access WebUI**: Open `https://your-project-name.pages.dev/`
2. **Configure API Key**: Enter your set key in the "API Configuration" section of the page
3. **Start Using**: You can now test TTS functionality directly on the webpage!

#### New Feature Usage Instructions

- **History Page**: Visit `https://your-project-name.pages.dev/history` to view all TTS generation history
- **Sharing Feature**: Click "Share" button on history page to generate share links and set passwords
- **Share Page**: Visit `https://your-project-name.pages.dev/share/{id}` to view shared audio content
- **API Key Verification**: All API requests need to include `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` in request headers

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

**Issues that may occur during first deployment**:

- **502 Error** may appear immediately after deployment
- This is normal as Cloudflare needs time to initialize the service
- **Solution**: Wait 1-2 minutes, or refresh the page several times
- This issue won't occur again after service stabilizes

### üéµ Voice Selection Guide

#### OpenAI Compatible Voices

- `shimmer` - Gentle female voice (zh-CN-XiaoxiaoNeural)

**üí° Custom Voice Mapping**: You can modify the `OPENAI_VOICE_MAP` object in the `_worker.js` file to customize voice mapping relationships:

```javascript
const OPENAI_VOICE_MAP = {
  shimmer: "zh-CN-XiaoxiaoNeural", // Can be changed to other Microsoft voices
  alloy: "zh-CN-YunyangNeural", // Can be changed to other Microsoft voices
  fable: "zh-CN-YunjianNeural", // Can be changed to other Microsoft voices
  onyx: "zh-CN-XiaoyiNeural", // Can be changed to other Microsoft voices
  nova: "zh-CN-YunxiNeural", // Can be changed to other Microsoft voices
  echo: "zh-CN-liaoning-XiaobeiNeural", // Can be changed to other Microsoft voices
};
```

Changes require redeployment to take effect.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Limitations

- **Character Limit**: This version of the script is designed to run stably on **Cloudflare Free Plan**. To ensure this, there is an implicit upper limit for single request text length, approximately **120,000 characters** (`~50 * 2500`). This is completely sufficient for the vast majority of application scenarios (including converting entire long articles). Beyond this length, the API will return a clear error message.
